Tutorial
========

In this tutorial we will describe how `biosppy` enables the development of
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning workflows for the analysis of
biosignals. The major goal of this package is to make these tools easily
available to anyone wishing to start playing around with biosignal data,
regardless of their level of knowledge in the field of Data Science. Throughout
this tutorial we will discuss the major features of `biosppy` and introduce the
terminology used by the package.
